**In memory of my borked flash drive**
You may have noticed a new binary on the repo called bork, all it does it print 'I borked something again', I made it when I borked my flash drive recently, it is only a small c file so I paste teh code for it here

```
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  printf("I borked something again\n");
  return 0;
}
```
